This sample walks through a basic example of a Java EE Application using the
Java Persistence API (JPA) for Object-Relational Mapping.

2. Using the "Entity Classes from Database..." wizard to create an Entity for
   the PRODUCT_CODE table in the Java DB Sample Database.
3. Updating the `main` method of the `Main` class to create an `EntityManager`.
4. Performing various procedures against the `ProductCode` Entity class.
